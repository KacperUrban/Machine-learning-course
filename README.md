# Data preprocessing
This task was to get some knowledge about Pokemons dataset. So I have done:
- basic statistics (describe, info etc.)
- basic visualization
- use groupby statements to uncover hidden relationships
- correlation plots
- interpret and handle missing data
- use t-sne to interpret data

Thanks to that I have discovered some inconsistent values (some metrics had a negative values). But overall data was in a good condition. All code you can find in Projekt_nr_1.ipynb.
# Data classification I
That part of the project was mainly focused on to used numeric data to classify name, type 1 and type 2 of the pokemons. So I have done:
- analyze basic statistics
- analyze missing values and remove it
- remove inconsistent data
- encode categorical features
- normalize numerical features
- train few models: Logisitic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN
- visualize confusion matrix
- calculate few metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score
# Technologies
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Missingno
# Status
The project is on going.
