# Data preprocessing
This task was to get some knowledge about Pokemons dataset. So I have used:
- basic statistics (describe, info etc.)
- basic visualization
- use groupby statements to uncover hidden relationships
- correlation plots
- interpret and handle missing data
- use t-sne to interpret data

Thanks to that I have discovered some inconsistent values (some metrics had a negative values). But overall data was in a good condition. All code you can find in Projekt_nr_1.ipynb.
